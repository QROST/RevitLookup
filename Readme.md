Interactive Revit `RFA` and `RVT` project database exploration tool to view and navigate BIM element parameters, properties and relationships.

Please refer to [The Building Coder](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com) for more information.

## Installation

- Go to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/releases/latest) section.
- Download and run MSI file.

The installer contains all the latest versions starting from the 2015 version of Revit.

## Build

Debugging:

- Run **Debug Profile** in Visual Studio or **Run Configuration** in JetBrains Rider. The required files have been added. All project files will be automatically copied to the
  Revit plugins folder.

Creating a package:

- Open the terminal of your IDE.
- Install Nuke global tools `dotnet tool install Nuke.GlobalTool --global`.
- Run `nuke` command.
- The generated package will be in the **output** folder.

For more information on building, see the [**RevitTemplates**](https://github.com/Nice3point/RevitTemplates) Wiki page.

## Caveat &ndash; RevitLookup Cannot Snoop Everything

This clarification was prompted by the [issue #35 &ndash; RevitLookup doesn't snoop all members](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/issues/35):

**Question:** I tried snooping a selected Structural Rebar element in the active view and found not all of the Rebar class members showed up in the Snoop Objects window. One of
many members that weren't there: `Rebar.GetFullGeometryForView` method.

Is this the expected behaviour? I was thinking I could get all object members just with RevitLookup and without the Revit API help file `RevitAPI.chm`.

**Answer:** RevitLookup cannot report **all** properties and methods on **all** elements.

For instance, in the case of `GetFullGeometryForView`, a view input argument is required. How is RevitLookup supposed to be able to guess what view you are interested in?

For methods requiring dynamic input that cannot be automatically determined, you can
[make use of more intimate interactive database exploration tools, e.g. RevitPythonShell](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/11/intimate-revit-database-exploration-with-the-python-shell.html).
